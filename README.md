# Automation Tool

## Overview
This Automation Tool is a Tkinter-based GUI application designed to automate mouse clicking on specific screen areas. It allows users to select or take screenshots of target images and set parameters for the automation process. The tool uses `pyautogui` for GUI automation, `PIL` for image handling, and `pynput` for mouse event listening.
